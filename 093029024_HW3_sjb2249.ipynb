    "### Final Note on Google Reviews API Limitation\n",
    "It's worth noting that Google returns only the most relevant 5 reviews through their API, so we may not be seeing the full spectrum of all customer feedback for Torrisi. Moreover, we are completely reliant on the embedding model used by OpenAI to 'understand' sentiment, i.e., we have no idea where the boundary is drawn between positive, neutral, and negative sentiment under the hood.\n",
